        <b><p style="margin: 5px 100px 20px 350px;">Sam was studying arts at a university in Istanbul, and he would go to a nearby cafe every day to buy coffee. He would spend so much money on a cup of coffee every day that he could use it for something else.
            He decided to save his money and buy a coffee maker so he could make it himself at a lower cost. In the first month, he only drank espresso and Americano because he did not know how to make anything else, but he loved change and experimenting with other types. He was always looking for places to teach, but he did not find a place that would stock his types of coffee in one place. He explained the recipes through a video, in a very clear way, with precise quantities, so that he could make a cup of coffee like a cafe. During his search, he found the Beanery website, and it became He tries a new recipe every day until he becomes a very professional and saves his money in a wonderful way.</p></b>
